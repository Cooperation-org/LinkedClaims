Alice has worked in warehouse distribution centers since she dropped out of high school to earn money to support her mother, and siblings, after her mother was forced to recuperate from injuries incurred in a vehicle accident.

Alice started as a custodian but over time and through observation and conversation with her co-workers she learned she could get trained to drive a warehouse forklift and significantly increase her earning potential. She enrolled in class 4 OSHA certified forklift driver training course while continuing her night custodian job. After receiving her certification she applied for a forklift driver opening at the company where she was employed but sought corroboration of her skills both from her instructors at ISETA (Bootcamp 1.0) and the forklift specialization course, along with an LinkedClaim from her current supervisor attesting to her reliability, teamwork, and attention to detail she has expressed in her current job.

Alice sends the self-asserted credential describing her skills relevant to the forklift driver position to Bob, her instructor ay ISETA of the OSHA forklift training course by email and points out the attributes she thinks he can attest to amongst her skill claims.

Alice does the same thing sending her self-assertion credential to Juanita,her current supervisor, pointing out those attributes she suggests Juanita has direct knowledge about her performance.

Both Bob and Juanita construct a linked-claims Verifiable Credential endorsing Alice for those attributes they have expertise in and can address with professional credibility based on their own bona fides included in their relevance arrestations describing their own training and background.

Juanita and Bob send their self-asserted skill LinkedClaims to Alice after binding their attributions to those skills and competencies based on their knowledge of Aliceâ€™s capabilities. Alice selects these credentials for inclusion in the set she prepares as a verifiable presentation to submit to the job application site.
