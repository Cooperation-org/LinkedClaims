Independent corroboration of use of funds is an important capability for verification that disaster recovery funds are well used.

In this narrative, a volunteer independently corroborates an agency's claim.

The recovery agency "BEMA" publishes a claim about how many people they have helped and how many ongoing projects they have.

An independent volunteer "Vic Volunteer" working with the funders receives a list of 20 addresses where work is ongoing, and randomly selects one to visit.  She documents her visit and verifies with the foreman that funds were indeed received from BEMA for the work, and
photographs the repairs in progress.  She uploads the photo to dropbox and using a simple interface, issues a signed credential attesting to her observations.
