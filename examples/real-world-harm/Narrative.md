This narrative is about a real disappearance of student activists in Myanmar, by the military junta, and also about the business relationship of POSCO with the junta. 

The disapparance was documented in an article on Myanmar NOW website.  The business relationship was docmented on a different website, Justice for Myanmar.  

By standardizing the incident report of the enforced disappearances and the relationship between POSCO and the Junta into signed claims using a common identifier for the junta in both claims, it is possible to connect incidents to business partners (and subsequently to their investors and board members) in order to request assistance and demand accountability.

This is not a theoretical case.
