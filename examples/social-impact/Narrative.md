This narrative is about two NGOs, one of which legitimately helps recipients and the other which inflates their claims.  For accoutnability, the funders of the NGOs have asked them to identify the DIDs of recipients and provide a secure interface for those recipients to privately review the impact of the NGOs.  In addition, they may attest to each other's credibility.

The NGO Helpers Intl donated a smart phone to Kiyana, who appreciated it and provided a direct positive review, including an estimate of the donation value of $200 USD.

The NGO Fakers Intl claimed to have helped Kiyano to get a new house and job with a total value of $20000 USD.

Kiyano independently reviewed Fakers Intl and disputed the specific claim, giving information that he had been paid only $20 to go to the site and support them.  

Filbert attested to Kiyano's credibility with a claim that Kiyano had once lent him money to pay his rent.

In this case the funders might want to make the claims from recipient privately encrypted for their security, and return only aggregate scores.
