# **Introduction**:

That Verifiable Credentials are signed by a DID has value, but to actually evaluate the credibility of a VC it is necessary to know something about the DID, essentially to embed the VC in a social graph.

The LinkedClaims vocabulary is designed for exactly this, for easily adding validations to existing claims or to entities such as DIDs, in a standard and minimal vocabulary, as well as hashlinking proof documents with a multibase hash.

A Verifiable Presentation of not only a single claim, but hashlinked supporting documents and signed claims validating the original, allows the user to evaluate not only the fact of a signature but to estimate the credibility of the claim.
