# **Introduction**:

That Verifiable Credentials are signed by a DID has value, but to actually evaluate the credibility of a VC it is necessary to know something about the DID, essentially to embed the VC in a social graph.

The LinkedClaims vocabulary is designed for exactly this, for easily adding validations to existing claims or to entities such as DIDs, in a standard and minimal vocabulary.

A reference presentation displaying the minimal characteristics for naive users to easily navigate and add to a social graph of claims is the subject of this paper.
